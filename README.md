# BlackJack-Android


This project is implementation of Black Jack game written in Kotlin. The player starts with $1000 balance and doubles bet if he/she beats the dealer.

There is also UI test part written with Espresso 3.3.0. When you run the UI test, the bot deals $200 for each round of the game, and plays the game until the balance is lower than $200. 

It is just fun project for me to experience Kotlin and Espresso. Layouts may not fully fit for all devices. Feel free to make improvements.
